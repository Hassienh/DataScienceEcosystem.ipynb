### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
#### This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
 N: 3;
B: 4;
F: 5;
AL: (N*4)+F;
run: AL


return $hours = intval(intval(200) / 3600);

### Objectives:
### some of the key takeaways from the course
#### 1. List popular languages for Data Science.
#### 2.allow the user to bring together data, code, and prose, to tell an interactive, computational story
#### 3.Data exploration, data cleaning, and plot building
#### 4.Jupyter Notebook good for machine learning
